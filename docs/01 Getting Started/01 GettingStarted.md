If you haven't registered your app on the SuperAwesome Dashboard yet, you can do that by going to [http://dashboard.superawesome.tv](http://dashboard.superawesome.tv) and creating a new app. Before we approve your user, you can start testing with our [demo placements](/docs/iossdk/Demo%20Placements).

Once your app is created, or if you already had an app registered, the app ID is shown in the dashboard page. Furthermore, if you are planning to use the advertising features of the SDK, you can customise the ad placements on this site.

To get SuperAwesome ads working in your app you will only have to note down your placement ID from our dashboard.
