The first step in integrating the SuperAwesome SDK is to register on the `SuperAwesome Dashboard <http://dashboard.superawesome.tv>`_
and create a new app.

Once your app is registered, you can create placements for it and use the documentation provided below to integrate them into your iOS application.

We also provide some demo placements that can be used for testing. These placements have a 100% fill rate.
